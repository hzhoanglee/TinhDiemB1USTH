Simple PHP Script to help students calculate their First Year GPA for USTH Students

## To use this tool, go to
https://b1.hz.edu.vn

## Features
- Wut do you want more than calculating your GPA and understand that you cannot get a scholarship? (or if you do, congrats)
- Fetch students' information and filter selected courses (not applicable for option 1/option 2)
- That's all
## How to install your own?
Seriously, Why you want to self-hosting this script?
But if you do, just import the sql file to a DB (student information is not included) and then change db.php. Then throw all this cr*p to wherever can run PHP with Apache/Nginx/LiteSpeed. And you are now good to go.
## Template
Yea, I dunno how to code, so I used this template: Stack's Neptune. Can be bought [here](https://themeforest.net/item/neptune-multipurpose-bootstrap-5-admin-dashboard-template/33492192)
## Disclaimer
This is just for reference information. So do not enter your result here and then tell the school to give you scholarship. Calculation can be wrong since I'm not good at Maths, feel free to correct it in the Issue.
